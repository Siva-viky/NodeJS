JavaScript Basic Refresher

1. Weakly typed language
    > no explicit type assignment to variables
    > data types can be switched dynamically (careful; can cause lot of issues)
2. Object oriented language
    > data can be organised in logical objects
    > need to know about and difference between primitive and reference types
3. Versatile language
    > Runs in browser and directly on a PC or server
    > Can perform a broad variety of tasks
